      <p>Currently, as postdoctoral researcher, I am engaged in a European project for <strong> <u>"Implementation of Machine Learning techniques to optimize laser-plasma accelerators experimentally and numerically for industrial and medical applications"</u></strong> with Physique à Haute Intensité (PHI) group under the supervision of Dr. Sandrine Dobosz at CEA-IRAMIS.</p>

      <h3>Aim of the project:</h3> <h4>(Nov. 2024 - Present)</h4>
      <p>The purpose of this research work is to implement a Machine Learning (ML) solution to optimize the properties of the electrons accelerated in the brand new 100 TW-class experimental facility for dosimetry and radiobiology experiments. The second phase of the project is in using ML to implement a surrogate model able to predict the properties of the electrons accelerated with a LPA as a function of the laser and the plasma properties, over a large parameter space. The third phase of the project would consist in coupling the output of Particle-In-Cell simulations or of the aforementioned surrogate model to a Monte Carlo code such as Geant4-DNA, in order to simulate the effect of electron bunches accelerated with LPAs. The initial phases of the project is in collaboration with GSI, Germany. As the part of EuroLabs network, the project benefits from a ML-toolkit (GeOFF) developed by GSI, Germany. The ML-toolkit orginally conceived for conventional accelerators is being adapted by us for the specificities of LPA and tested on experimental facility at CEA for validation.</p>
