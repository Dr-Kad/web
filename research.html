    <div>
      <p>Currently, as postdoctoral researcher, I am engaged in a European project for <strong> <u>"Implementation of Machine Learning techniques to optimize laser-plasma accelerators experimentally and numerically for industrial and medical applications"</u></strong> with Physique à Haute Intensité (PHI) group under the supervision of Dr. Sandrine Dobosz at CEA-IRAMIS.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="experience-item">
      <h3>Aim of the project:</h3> <h4>(Nov. 2024 - Present)</h4>
      <p>The purpose of this research work is to implement a Machine Learning (ML) solution to optimize the properties of the electrons accelerated in the brand new 100 TW-class experimental facility for dosimetry and radiobiology experiments. The second phase of the project is in using ML to implement a surrogate model able to predict the properties of the electrons accelerated with a LPA as a function of the laser and the plasma properties, over a large parameter space. The third phase of the project would consist in coupling the output of Particle-In-Cell simulations or of the aforementioned surrogate model to a Monte Carlo code such as Geant4-DNA, in order to simulate the effect of electron bunches accelerated with LPAs. The initial phases of the project is in collaboration with GSI, Germany. As the part of EuroLabs network, the project benefits from a ML-toolkit (GeOFF) developed by GSI, Germany. The ML-toolkit orginally conceived for conventional accelerators is being adapted by us for the specificities of LPA and tested on experimental facility at CEA for validation.</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Doctoral Research</h2>

    <div>
      <p>I have pursued my Ph.D. on the topic of <strong> <u>"Theoretical investigation of electron acceleration in laser produced plasma"</u></strong> in the Computational Plasma Physics Group under the supervision of Prof. Arvinder Singh at Dr. B.R. Ambedkar National Instiute of Technololgy, Jalandhar, Punjab, India.</p>

      <h3>Aim of the project:</h3> <h4>(Aug. 2018 - July 2024)</h4>
      <p>During my doctoral studies, I investigated theoretical aspects of interaction of intense lasers pulses with plasma. My PhD work was primarily focused on understanding the dynamics of intense  Laguerre-Gaussian laser pulses, analyzing their spatial and temporal evolution, and studying their effect on electron acceleration in different regimes of plasma medium. By leveraging advanced computational models and the method of moments approach and utilizing suitable laser and plasma parameters, I explored the complex interaction between intense laser pulses and plasma medium, aiming to uncover the fundamental mechanism of electron acceleration in different regimes of plasma.</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Master Research Project</h2>

    <div>
      <p>I have also done a research project during my M.Sc. on the topic <strong> <u>"Second Harmonic Generation of self-focused Gaussian and dark hollow laser beams inside relativistic plasma medium"</u></strong> under the supervision of Prof. Arvinder Singh at Dr. B.R. Ambedkar National Instiute of Technololgy, Jalandhar, Punjab, India.</p>
  <h3>Aim of the project:</h3>
  <p>The aim of the project was to optimize the efficiency of second harmonics generated during the interaction of Gaussian and dark hollow laser beams with plasma in relativistic regime</p>

      <h3><u>With Masters Candidates</u> :</h3>
      <p>During my Doctoral studies, I had the privilege of  mentoring Masters students, guiding them through their research projects. Together, we explored topics such as generation of Terahertz radiation, plasma acceleration and Harmonics generation during laser plasma interactions, leading to successful completion of their respective research projects. Our collaborative efforts results in the publication of five research papers in peer-reviewed SCI-indexed international journals.</p>

    <div class="experience-item">
      <h3><u>Additional Work</u> :</h3>
      <p>In addition to the above work, I was also engaged in utilizing Particle-In-Cell (PIC) codes- SMILEI and EPOCH to explore and optimize electron and ion acceleration during interaction of different spatially-structured laser profiles like Laguerre-Gaussian, Bessel-Gaussian, etc. with plasma medium in respective regimes.</p>
